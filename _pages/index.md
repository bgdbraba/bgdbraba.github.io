After studying a bachelor in IT, a master in software engineering and 7 years at the [largest IT consulting firm of the world](https://www.accenture.com/be-en), the time felt right to start my own IT consulting company **OutOfMemory**.

## Mission
Supporting IT departments that run out of memory by scaling their memory vertically with knowledge or horizontally with time.

*Please refer to [Services](https://www.outofmemory.consulting/services) for more information.*

## Vision
Become a trusted advisor for small and medium enterprises in the area of IT strategy, IT architecture and IT project management.

<!-- ## Values 
Inspired from the agile manifesto, we prefer the left over right (without ignoring the right)
1. Quality over Time 
2. Pragmatism over Dogmatism
-->
