## Short-term engagements
### IT Strategy Assessment
This pertains a typical 3 to 6 months engagement ending with an IT strategy and (if wanted) a 3 to 5-year roadmap to guide your IT future, typically in the form of a slide deck.

Typical process:
1. Knowledge gathering phase: 
    1. Read-through of the current business and IT strategy (if already existing).
    2. Performing interviews with all key stakeholders (jointly defined) on both business and IT side to identify the current IT challenges as well as the business dreams. 
    3. Documenting the "as is" situation for discussion and alignment
2. Co-creation phase: 
    1. Workshops to define and align on the IT target 3 to 5 years in the future. Depending the necessity, this can be limited to the technology architecture, but can be expanded to the IT organisation.
    2. Documenting the IT target for discussion and alignment
    3. Workshops to shape the high-level initiatives that need to lead to the IT target situation. 
    4. Documenting the initiatives for discussion and alignment
3. Conclusion phase: 
    1. Summarize the target and initiaves as IT strategy
    2. Presenting the IT strategy to C-level or similar stakeholders
4. Propagation phase:    
    1. Defining a plan for socializing the IT strategy amongst the organisation 
    2. Executing the plan

Additionally, the initiatives can be _timelined_ in a roadmap, and even _business cased_ to support forecasting.

Note this type of assessment requires full sponsorship on executive level and needs to occur in co-creation mode to have a high chance on success.
